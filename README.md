# Idea #1
## Speed Card Game

This project will mimic the card game known
as speed. The user will play against a bot that 
gets increasingly more difficult upon every win until
the bot finally beats the user. The rules of the game
are listed below. This game will be used by a single
player to play the card game against the computer. 
This project is of interest to me because I want
to see if I can mimic my favorite card game and put
it into code. 

**Rules** of the game:
- The player is given 5 cards in their hand
and 10 cards in their bank
- There are two piles in the middle to play on
- The user puts a card from their hand on an 
appropriate pile in the middle. 
- Appropriate moves consist of playing a card 1 higher,
one lower or the same number as the current card. 
- When a card is played, you pickup a card from your
bank to maintain 5 cards in hand at all times
- The winner of the game is the player who runs out
of cards in the bank and cards in their hand first

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to add my game information to
a statistics board and see these statistics once I lose
- As a user, I want to be able to view the current 
cards in my hand
- As a user, I want to be able to control which pile 
I am placing a card on
- As a user, I want to decide which card in my hand I am
using

# My Team Manager
## A passion project by Noah

My Team Manager is an application where you
can keep track of information surrounding your
soccer team. This project will provide the 
functionality of storing information about a team 
that can be accessed as statistics. For example seeing
the top goalscorer on your team. This application
will be used by coaches and managers of soccer teams
who want to keep track of their teams performance
and access statistics in order to make decisions about 
the team. I am interested in this project because as
someone who plays in a soccer league I would like a 
software to manage all of our past games.

## User Stories
- As a user I want to be able to log past games to a team
- As a user I want to be able to access a list of all games a player has scored in
- As a user I want to be able to create as many teams as I want
- As a user I want to be able to add and remove players from a team

## Idea #3

# Poco Monopoly

Poco Monopoly is a knockoff *Monopoly*
with some changes to the structure of the game.
In general, this game will be an
effort to mimic the iconic board game.
This project will be used by 2 people on the same
device to play the game. This project is
interesting to me because I have always enjoyed
the game of Monopoly and wanted to take the general
concept of the game and recreate it.


The **rules** are as follows:
- Poco Monopoly is a two player game
- Both players start out with X money
- At a players turn, they will roll dice and
  move an according amount of spaces
- Everytime you **land** on the starting square,
  you get X money.
- Landing on an unknown property will give you
  the opportunity to buy it
- Landing on a property owned by someone else
  forces you to pay rent
- Landing on your own property provides you with
  the opportunity to add a hotel.
  at a specified cost to yourself
- The game ends when one player runs out of money


## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add hotels on properties
- As a user, I want to be able to add my properties to a list that I can view
- As a user, I want to be able to have a choice of different moves I can make
- As a user, I want to be able to know where I currently am on the board


# Idea #4
## Money Splitter
For my project I want to be able to log purchases from
an individual and split them accordingly amongst 
however many people they want. This software will be
used by people wanting to split money between their friends
and have money they owe others accumulate and cancel out. 
This project is of interest to me because it is hard to
keep track of splitting money expenses with your friends
and someone always gets the short end of the stick. This
software will solve that problem that many people 
(especially broke university students) face. 

# User Stories

- As a user I want to be able to create logs of my purchases
and store them in a tracker. 
- As a user, I want to be able to view all my past expenses
- As a user, I want to be able to view all the people that
owe money and need to receive money. 
- As a user, I want to be able to unequally share the price
- of items amongst others based on the amount of shares
they have used
