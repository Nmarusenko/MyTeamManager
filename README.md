# Poco Monopoly
## A passion project by Noah

Poco Monopoly is a knockoff *Monopoly*
with some changes to the structure of the game.
In general, this game will be an
effort to mimic the iconic board game. 
This project will be used by 2 people on the same
device to play the game. This project is 
interesting to me because I have always enjoyed 
the game of Monopoly and wanted to take the general
concept of the game and recreate it. 


The **rules** are as follows:
- Poco Monopoly is a two player game
- Both players start out with X money
- At a players turn, they will roll dice and 
move an according amount of spaces
- Everytime you **land** on the starting square,
you get X money. 
- Landing on an unknown property will give you
the opportunity to buy it
- Landing on a property owned by someone else
forces you to pay rent
- Landing on your own property provides you with
the opportunity to 2x the rent 
at a specified cost to yourself
- The game ends when one player runs out of money
