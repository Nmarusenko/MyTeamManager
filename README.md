# Poco Monopoly
## A passion project by Noah

Poco Monopoly is a knockoff *Monopoly*
with some changes to the structure of the game.
In general, this game will be an
effort to mimic the iconic board game. 
This project will be used by 2 people on the same
device to play the game. This project is 
interesting to me because I have always enjoyed 
the game of Monopoly and wanted to take the general
concept of the game and recreate it. 


The **rules** are as follows:
- Poco Monopoly is a two player game
- Both players start out with X money
- At a players turn, they will roll dice and 
move an according amount of spaces
- Everytime you **land** on the starting square,
you get X money. 
- Landing on an unknown property will give you
the opportunity to buy it
- Landing on a property owned by someone else
forces you to pay rent
- Landing on your own property provides you with
the opportunity to add a hotel.
at a specified cost to yourself
- The game ends when one player runs out of money


## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add hotels on properties
- As a user, I want to be able to add my properties to a list that I can view
- As a user, I want to be able to have a choice of different moves I can make
- As a user, I want to be able to know where I currently am on the board


## Idea #2

# My Team Manager
## A passion project by Noah

My Team Manager is an application where you
can keep track of information surrounding your
soccer team. This project will provide the 
functionality of storing information about a team 
that can be accessed as statistics. For example seeing
the top goalscorer on your team. This applicaition
will be used by coaches and managers of soccer teams
who want to keep track of their teams performance
and access statistics in order to make decisions about 
the team. I am interested in this project because as
someone who plays in a soccer league I would like a 
software to manage all of our past games.

## User Stories
- As a user I want to be able to log past games to a team
- As a user I want to be able to access a list of all games a player has scored in
- As a user I want to be able to create as many teams as I want
- As a user I want to be able to add and remove players from a team
