# My Team Manager
## A passion project by Noah

My Team Manager is an application where you
can keep track of information surrounding your
soccer team. This project will provide the 
functionality of storing information about a team 
that can be accessed as statistics. For example seeing
the top goalscorer on your team. This application
will be used by coaches and managers of soccer teams
who want to keep track of their teams performance
and access statistics in order to make decisions about 
the team. I am interested in this project because as
someone who plays in a soccer league I would like a 
software to manage all of our past games.
